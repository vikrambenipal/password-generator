# Password Generator App
## Built using React.js and Material UI

This app generates a random password according to the user's specification (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, symbols, numbers, length). 
Once a password is generated the app will indicate how strong that password is and the user is able to copy onto their clipboard.

## Learning 
I really enjoyed learning more about Material UI, especially when it came to adding personal customization to pre-existing components.
